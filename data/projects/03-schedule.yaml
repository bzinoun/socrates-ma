  The conference starts Thursday at 15h00 and ends Sunday at 13h00.

  The rooms at the Hotel are available from 14h00 on Thursday to Sunday 12h00.

  ### Format

  The event will be run as one day [Open Space](http://agilecoachcamp.org/tiki-index.php?page=OpenSpace).

  Open Space means there is no agenda, or rather: you set the agenda. This is your time, make the best of it! For ideas about what you can do in advance have a look at this article.

  Facilitation will be in French/English. However, it will be possible to run sessions in other languages.

  ### Evening activities

  Participants organize evening activities. In other events like this one there were a multitude of things going on in the evenings, from music, over board games to live-hacking programs. And of course thereâ€™s always plenty of people to just talk to, or continue discussions from the day.
